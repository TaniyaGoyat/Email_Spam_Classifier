# 📧 Email Spam Classifier

An end-to-end machine learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Cleans and preprocesses raw email text data
- Converts text to numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Trains multiple classification models and selects **Multinomial Naive Bayes** as the best-performing model
- Interactive **Streamlit** web app for real-time spam detection
- Achieves high accuracy and precision on test data
