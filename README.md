# 📧 Email Spam Classifier

An end-to-end machine learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Cleans and preprocesses raw email text data
- Converts text to numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Trains multiple classification models and selects **Multinomial Naive Bayes** as the best-performing model
- Interactive **Streamlit** web app for real-time spam detection
- Achieves high accuracy and precision on test data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Streamlit**
- **Git** & **GitHub**

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded dataset and handled missing values
   - Performed text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical features

3. **Model Building**  
   - Trained and evaluated multiple models
   - Selected **Multinomial Naive Bayes** as the best model

4. **Deployment**  
   - Created a **Streamlit** web application for interactive classification
